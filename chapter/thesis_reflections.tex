	\section{User studies}
	    \label{sec:user_studies}
	    
	To ensure that our project achieves the aims mentioned in subsection \ref{sec:intro_objective}, we ran an informal user study with two of our peers, Constantinos Loizou and Avi Varma. Both are Computer Science students at Swansea University. Constantinos is a third year student while Avi is a Masters student. Both completed the Cryptography and IT Security and Writing Mobile Apps modules, and therefore are familiar with Android development and cyber security. The study consisted in them completing one challenge with minimal guidance from us and then providing feedback. Constantinos completed Broadcast Theft while Avi did Broadcast Theft - MITM.
	
	They both liked using the final product and said that the intended workflow made sense. More importantly, both said that completing the challenge taught them a lot about ICC vulnerabilities and made them aware of a type of attack they did not know about before. Avi said that "It was sufficiently difficult, fun and interactive enough. It achieves more than its purpose and it should be used by more people." Since the education tool succeeds in educationg developers about ICC vulnerabilities in Android, the project can be considered a success.
	
	The problems encountered during the study are relatively minor and are related to the UI or the explanations included. Both said that the technical background would be better organised into various sections rather than a very long text you need to scroll through, and that workflow explanation should have some small improvements. Constantinos complained in particular that the learning curve is very high initially. Another issue that both mentioned was that malware logs are very long and confusing at first.
	
	\section{Reflections on the schedule}
	    \label{sec:schedule_reflection}
	    
	The project schedule submitted as part of the Initial Document on the 2nd of November 2020 is included in Appendix \ref{app:project_schedule}. The project suffered due to delays from the very start. I was on a Year in Industry full time internship until 08.09.2020 and therefore had no little time to research cyber security over the summer. I settled on ICC vulnerabilities only a week before the Initial Document deadline.
